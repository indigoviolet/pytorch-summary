* PyTorch model summaries

This is based on https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary, but
modernizes and simplifies some of the code, and adds one important
feature: it supports arbitrary inputs instead of just torch Tensors.


** TODO:

*** Integrate with [[https://github.com/Fangyh09/pytorch-receptive-field][receptive field computation]]
